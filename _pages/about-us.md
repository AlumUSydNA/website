### Our mission

Welcome to the Sydney University Graduates Union North America
(SUGUNA), the vibrant alumni network connecting graduates, students,
and friends of the University of Sydney across the United States,
Canada, and Mexico.  At SUGUNA, our mission [since 1990](#history) has
been to cultivate a supportive and inclusive environment where alumni
can reconnect, share experiences, and contribute to the ongoing
success of the University of Sydney.

### Come to an event!

We hold in-person social and networking events, focused around where
our community lives.  We collaborate with the University using their
"glocal" event platform to manage in-person event registrations. If
you're a SUGUNA member, reach out to us if there is a cluster of
alumni in your region and we can work with you to help you host a
SUGUNA event. We've also started a series of virtual networking events
so that SUGUNA members can gather and form new seeds for future in-person
events centered around geographic areas in North America.

### Join us and stay connected

Membership in SUGUNA is open to all graduates of the University of
Sydney, former students, faculty members, and friends who share our

### SUGUNA History

SUGUNA was founded in 1990 by William Lew, Warwick Harvey-Smith and
Clifford Kwan-Gett who contacted their classmates that they knew to be
in North America. In addition they placed an advertisement in the
*Gazette* and obtained a listing of Sydney University graduates in the
U.S.A. and Canada. The first meeting was held in 1991 and Annual

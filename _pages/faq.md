# SUGUNA FAQ

## Purpose and activities

<details markdown="1">
<summary>What does SUGUNA do?</summary>

We are alumni and friends of Sydney University who run social and networking events throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico, aimed at connecting with one another and remaining connected to the university. We are always excited about ideas from our members about how best to do this (see [more on how to get involved](#getting-involved)).

Some of our previous activities have included larger-scale conferences, alumni awards, and scholarships. We welcome students from Sydney University who are here temporarily as part of their studies or training, and we are proud to represent the interests of our members in North America.

For example, SUGUNA was involved in promoting changes in Australian law to allow retention of Australian citizenship upon gaining another citizenship — this change happened in 2002. SUGUNA also contributed a letter to a 2004 Australian Senate Inquiry into the expatriate community that was included in the committee’s final report ["They Still Call Australia Home"](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/Completed_inquiries/2004-07/expats03/report/index). This [letter](https://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/wopapub/senate/committee/legcon_ctte/completed_inquiries/2004_07/expats03/submissions/sub193_doc.ashx) encouraged the Australian government to more fully engage with the Australian Diaspora community, and automatically reinstated Australian citizenship to native-born Australians who lost it before the 2002 law change.

## Membership questions

<details markdown="1" id="membership-check">
<summary>Am I a member of SUGUNA?</summary>

Yes! If you’re receiving this email, you are a member. Membership does not need to be renewed and is ongoing unless you request removal. This is now [a self-serve process](#mailing-list-leaving-suguna).

</details>

<details markdown="1" id="membership-retaining">
<summary>Do I need to do anything to remain a member?</summary>

No! Membership continues as long as you wish. Keep your subscription active with a current email address to remain in good standing.

You can [update to details](#membership-details-updates). To leave SUGUNA, [see this question](#mailing-list-leaving-suguna). All members must provide accurate information about their connection to the University.

</details>

<details markdown="1" id="membership-vs-subscriber">
<summary>Why am I a “member” instead of just a “subscriber”?</summary>

Being a member allows you to vote on SUGUNA’s direction!
SUGUNA is a US-based 501(c)(7) tax-exempt social club. Our [by-laws](https://www.sydney.edu.au/dam/corporate/documents/alumni-giving/alumni/networks/suguna-bylaws.pdf) give ultimate control to members, typically exercised via the AGM. This mailing list helps track members, determine quorums, and notify members of AGMs and membership-wide actions.

- **Joining the mailing list** = becoming a member in good standing.
- **Leaving the mailing list** = stepping down as a member.

The AGM allows members to vote on Board nominations and by-law changes. With virtual AGMs, this list ensures all members are notified.

Learn more about tax-exempt social clubs on the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/social-clubs).

## Contributing financially

<details markdown="1" id="financial-support-suguna">
<summary>Do you have dues? How do I support SUGUNA financially?</summary>

We don't currently have mandatory membership dues, however, we can
accept contributions from members. Membership contributions to SUGUNA
the organization directly, by supporting expenses for our operations
(although have no staff and all operations are run by volunteers, we
have hosting and platform expenses).  Contributions are not passed
through to the University of Sydney.

In addition, although we are a *tax-exempt* charity, as a 501(c)(7)
membership benefit organization, contributions are **not**
*tax-deductible* for the member. Please [contact
us](#mailing-list-contact) for details on how to contribute.

</details>

<details markdown="1" id="financial-support-usyd">
<summary>I'm based in North America—how do I support the University of Sydney?</summary>

* United States

  Donations to the [University of Sydney USA
  Foundation](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engage/give/how-to-donate/usa-foundation-impact.html),
  which is a 501(c)(3) charity.  are tax-deductible and can be
  earmarked for specific purposes, including SUGUNA-related
  activities.  Note: By law, no more than 35% of SUGUNA’s income may
  come from general donations of this kind, as our primary focus must
  remain on community services.

* Canada and Mexico

  Canadian and Mexican-based supporters can contribute through
  international giving mechanisms; however, tax treatment varies, so
  local advice is recommended.

## Mailing list 

<details markdown="1" id="mailing-list-subscribe">
<summary>Why am I subscribed to this list?</summary>

You are subscribed to this list because you are a SUGUNA member! You joined SUGUNA either via the [SUGUNA website](https://usydnorthamerica.org/) or at a SUGUNA event.

</details>

<details markdown="1" id="mailing-list-contents">
<summary>What will be posted on the list?</summary>

This list is used to send notifications about SUGUNA governance that must be sent to all members, such as the Annual General Meeting (AGM). It is not possible to opt-out of these notifications unless you choose to leave SUGUNA entirely by unsubscribing.

We also send announcements about SUGUNA events and opportunities to meet fellow alumni and members in your region. You can opt out of these event notifications if you wish. Overall, this is a fairly low-volume list.

</details>


<details markdown="1" id="mailing-list-usyd">
<summary>Why do I need to subscribe separately if I provided my details to the University?</summary>

SUGUNA is legally separate from the University, and privacy laws prevent direct data sharing. As an independent 501(c)(7) organization, we maintain our own member list. Members are encouraged to also update their information with the University [here](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engage/alumni/update-your-details.html).

</details>

<details markdown="1" id="mailing-list-membership">
<summary>Can I remain a member but unsubscribe from the list?</summary>

No — membership and mailing list subscription are equivalent.  

You **can** opt-out of all non-essential emails by updating your preferences and unselecting **“All other announcements (events etc.)”**, ensuring you only receive membership-related emails like AGMs.

</details>

<details markdown="1" id="mailing-list-leaving-suguna">
<summary>How do I remove myself from the list?</summary>

You can click “Unsubscribe” from the bottom of any email that you
receive from the list and you will be removed from this mailing list
**and as a member of SUGUNA**.

If you change your mind later, you may rejoin by re-signing up at any
time, via the [SUGUNA website](https://usydnorthamerica.org/).

If you can't find any emails from us (search for emails from
"**usydnorthamerica.org**" ), please [contact
us](#mailing-list-contact).

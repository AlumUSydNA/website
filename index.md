<!--  <small>We work with alumni and the extended North American USyd community and to support the University and each other.</small> -->
<!-- {% include feature_row id="intro" type="center" %}  -->

We are alumni and friends of the University of Sydney who run social
and networking events throughout the United States, Canada, and
Mexico, aimed at connecting with one another and remaining connected
to the university.  We are always excited about ideas from our members
about how best to do this. Some of our previous activities have also
included larger scale conferences, alumni awards, and scholarships. We
welcome into our group students from USyd who are here temporarily as
part of their studies or training, and we are proud to represent the
interests of our members in North America.

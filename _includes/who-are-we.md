## Who are we?

We are a United States-based 501(c)7 not-for-profit organisation operating since 1990 that works with alumni and the extended USyd community to support each other and the [University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au) in North America. You can download our current [by-laws](assets/downloads/suguna-bylaws-2025.pdf) as amended in the Special Meeting of Members held August 11, 2025.

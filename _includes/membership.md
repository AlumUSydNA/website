are the same thing**.  This will enable you to and participate in business
decisions of SUGUNA, and receive updates about the organization and
events. If you are already a SUGUNA member, please update you contact

## Updating your details with the University

Joining SUGUNA and the mailing list **does not** update your details
with the University. Although we closely collaborate with the
University as part of the the University of Sydney's [international
networks](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engage/alumni/get-involved/networks/international.html),
we are a separate US-based non-profit organization, and are not part
of the University.  We also encourage you to **[update your
details](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engage/alumni/update-your-details.html)**
with the University directly.
